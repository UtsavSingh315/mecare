# Frontend Integration Complete 🎉

The MeCare frontend has been successfully integrated with the database and authentication system. The app is now fully dynamic and connected to PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### Authentication System

- **AuthContext**: React context for managing authentication state
- **AuthGuard**: Component that protects routes and redirects unauthenticated users
- **Real Login/Signup**: Forms now connect to the actual API and database
- **Token-based Auth**: Secure token management with localStorage persistence
- **Auto-login**: Users stay logged in across browser sessions

### Dynamic Frontend

- **Dashboard**: Fetches real user data from `/api/users/[userId]/dashboard`
- **Daily Logging**: Saves actual log entries to the database via `/api/daily-logs`
- **Real User Data**: Displays authentic streaks, badges, and statistics
- **Loading States**: Proper UX with loading indicators
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

### API Security

- **Protected Endpoints**: All APIs require valid authentication tokens
- **User Authorization**: Users can only access their own data
- **Input Validation**: Proper request validation and sanitization

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will run on `http://localhost:3001` (or 3000 if available)

### 2. Create an Account

- Visit the app in your browser
- You'll see the welcome screen since you're not authenticated
- Click "Create Account" to sign up
- Fill in your details (name, email, password, optional age)
- Account is created and you're automatically logged in

### 3. Use the Dashboard

- After login, you'll see your personalized dashboard
- Initially shows default data (0 streaks, no badges)
- As you use the app, data will become more meaningful

### 4. Log Daily Data

- Navigate to the "Log" tab
- Fill in your daily information:
  - Mood selection
  - Symptoms
  - Pain and energy levels
  - Period status
  - Notes
- Click "Save Today's Log" to store in the database
- Data immediately updates your streaks and statistics

### 5. View Your Progress

- Dashboard shows real-time updates
- Badges are earned based on your activity
- Streaks update automatically
- All data persists between sessions

## 🧪 Test Users

You can also log in with the pre-created test users:

```bash
# Create test users in the database
npm run db:create-users
```

Test accounts:

- **Email**: `jane@example.com`, **Password**: `password123`
- **Email**: `john@example.com`, **Password**: `password123`
- **Email**: `alice@example.com`, **Password**: `password123`

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Authentication Flow

1. User enters credentials on login/signup page
2. Frontend calls `/api/auth/login` or `/api/auth/signup`
3. Backend validates credentials and returns a token
4. Token is stored in localStorage and used for subsequent requests
5. AuthContext manages the authentication state globally
6. AuthGuard protects routes and redirects as needed

### Data Flow

1. Dashboard loads → fetches user data from `/api/users/[userId]/dashboard`
2. Log submission → sends data to `/api/daily-logs`
3. All API calls include authentication token in headers
4. Backend validates tokens and user permissions
5. Database is updated/queried via Drizzle ORM

### Components Updated

- `app/layout.tsx` - Added AuthProvider and AuthGuard
- `app/page.tsx` - Dynamic dashboard with real data
- `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Real authentication
- `app/auth/signup/page.tsx` - Real user creation
- `app/log/page.tsx` - Save actual log data
- `components/auth-guard.tsx` - Route protection
- `components/navigation.tsx` - Auth-aware navigation

### API Routes Enhanced

- `app/api/auth/*` - Full authentication system
- `app/api/users/[userId]/dashboard/route.ts` - User dashboard data
- `app/api/users/[userId]/insights/route.ts` - User insights with charts data
- `app/api/daily-logs/route.ts` - Daily log CRUD operations

## 🚀 Demo & Testing

Run the demo script to see everything in action:

```bash
./demo.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Login with: jane@example.com / password123
```

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **JWT Tokens**: Replace simple tokens with JWTs for better security
2. ✅ **Data Visualization**: Added charts and graphs to insights page
3. **Password Reset**: Implement forgot password functionality
4. **Email Verification**: Add email verification flow
5. **Push Notifications**: Add reminders and notifications
6. **Data Export**: Allow users to export their data
7. **Cycle Predictions**: Implement ML-based period predictions
8. **Social Features**: Add community aspects or sharing
